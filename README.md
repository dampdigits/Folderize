# Folderize

## About

- This bash script organizes your files with specified extensions by moving them into folders with their respective names.
- If a folder with the fileâ€™s name does not exist, the script will create one.
- Useful to manage files that are scattered in a directory haphazardly and not stored in proper folders.

## Usage

- Download the folderize.sh script from this repository.
- Navigate to the directory where folderize.sh is located.
- In a terminal run the program by typing ./folderize.sh /path/to/src /path/to/dest [extension1] [extension2] [extension3]

## Example

Suppose you have the following files in the directory D:\Sam\coding\source
